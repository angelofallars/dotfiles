## Waybar

My personal waybar config.

I don't recomend directly editing the `.css` file. Instead, use Sass and
edit the `style.scss` and `_colors.scss` files, allowing you for example, to
change the entire color of the bar with just one variable change.

[Install the latest version of Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases)
and run this in the `waybar/` directory:

```sass --watch . --no-source-map```
